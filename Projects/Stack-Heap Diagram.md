## Stack-Heap Diagram

The purpose of this exercise is to give you a deeper understanding of how memory works in Java.

It will take you about **1 hour** to complete the task.

Please be aware that the task status is **mandatory**.

*Please read carefully and do the following:*

1. Follow the code below and build a step-by-step Stack-Heap Diagram.
2. Doing this exercise, it is okay to omit intermediate states (like the states in expressions evaluation, system methods calls, and so on); however, make sure to note changes when named variables are created or user-defined methods are called.

**How to self-evaluate this task**

Please be aware that we expect the completed task to meet the following criteria:

- Stack-Heap Diagram is drawn to depict how variables and objects reside in stack and heap memory segments of the JVM.
- All primitive local variables and local references are depicted in the stack memory segment.
- The stack memory segment shows the correct order of method calls and variables pushed to the stack.
- All objects are depicted in the heap memory segment and properly linked to local references.

**You can get the maximum of 10 points for this task. To pass the task, you need to get 70% of the points.**

| **Depiction of local variables and local references**        | None of the primitive local variables and local references are depicted in the stack memory segment. | Half of the primitive local variables and local references are depicted in the stack memory segment. | 70% of the primitive local variables and local references are depicted in the stack memory segment. |                                                              |
| **Depiction of method calls and variables in the correct order** | The stack memory segment shows incorrect order of method calls and variables pushed to the stack. | Half of the method calls and variables pushed to the stack are depicted in the correct order. | The stack memory segment shows the correct order of method calls and variables pushed to the stack. |                                                              |
| **Depiction of objects linked to local references**          | None of the objects are depicted in the heap memory segment and properly linked to local references. | Half of the objects are depicted in the heap memory segment and properly linked to local references. |                                                              | 70% of the objects are depicted in the heap memory segment and properly linked to local references. |
