## Designing a Web Page

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if necessary) to design a web page. It will take you about **3 hours** to complete the task; so, occasionally, take a break to clear your head.

Please be aware that the task status is **mandatory**.

1. Please choose one from the list what variant of a page you want to design:
   - Catalogue (for example, a store catalogue, a library catalogue, etc.)
   - Form (for example, a social network registration form, an e-store request form, a tax declaration form, etc.)
   - Report (for example, groups' semester results report, a report on servers/virtual machines/services availability, etc.)
2. When you have picked one of these three, design a web page using HTML and CSS. You may use JavaScript as well if it is necessary for your solution. Then send the designed page.
