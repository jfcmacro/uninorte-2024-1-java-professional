## Object-Oriented Thinking

The purpose of this task is to gain hands-on experience of how to understand requirements for a chosen system and design class diagrams by picturing classes.

The task should be submitted as txt, doc, rtf, docx, or pdf attachment.

It will take you about **3 hours** to complete the task; so, occasionally, take a break to clear your head.

Please be aware that the task status is **mandatory**.

### **Task Description**

Select from the following options the system for which the class hierarchy will be developed.

1. Table or Card Games simulations:
   - Chess
   - Checkers
   - Narde
   - Go
   - ...
2. Publicly available devices/services:
   - a public printer/copier at a university
   - a public coffee/vending machine at a
   - university/dormitory/hospital/street
   - a public phone booth on a street
   - ...
3. Scheduling/Management systems:
   - Dormitory accommodation management
   - Zoo animals' nutrition management
   - Robotized warehouse management
   - ...

*Please read carefully and do the following:*

1. Describe the requirements for the chosen system: functional and non-functional.
2. Design use cases for the system based on the requirements.
3. Identify objects, classes, and relationships in the system. Optionally, design CRC cards.
4. Design class diagrams picturing classes, their attributes, and relations in the system.
5. Optionally, convert diagrams into Java code.
6. Send the following results: requirements, use cases, CRCs (optional), class diagrams, Java code of the classes.

### **How to self-evaluate this task:**

Please be aware that we expect the completed task to meet the following criteria:

1. Functional and non-functional requirements for a chosen system should be described.
2. Use cases for the system should be designed according to the requirements.
3. Objects, classes, and relationships in the system should be identified. Optionally, CRC cards should be designed.
4. Class diagrams picturing classes, their attributes and relations in the system should be designed.
5. Optionally, diagrams should be converted into Java code.

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Requirements for the system**         | Functional and non-functional requirements are not described. | Either functional or non-functional requirements are not described. | Functional and non-functional requirements are described.    |                                                              |
| **Use cases**                           | Use cases for the system are not designed according to the requirements. | Use cases for the system are partly designed according to the requirements. | Use cases for the system are fully designed according to the requirements. |                                                              |
| **Objects, classes, and relationships** | Objects, classes, and relationships                          | Either objects or classes or relationships in the system are not identified. |                                                              | Objects, classes, and relationships in the system are identified. |
| **Class diagrams**                      | Class diagrams picturing classes, their attributes, and relations in the system are not designed. | Half of the class diagrams picturing classes, their attributes, and relations in the system are designed. |                                                              | Class diagrams picturing classes, their attributes, and relations in the system are designed. |
