## ER Design

The purpose of this task is to sketch out the design of a database. You will practice creating an ER diagram by defining the entities, their attributes and showing their relationships.

It will take you about **2 hours** to complete the task.
Please be aware that the task status is **mandatory**.

*Please read carefully and do the following:*

1. Choose one of the following variants of a system to design an ER diagram:
   - Table or Ticket Schedule simulations:
     - Airplane tickets
     - F1 competition
     - Cinema tickets
   - Publicly available devices/services:
     - Public WI-FI points in your city
     - Public electric car charges in your district
     - Public bicycle rental points in your country
   - Scheduling/Management systems:
     - Food delivery management system
     - Flowers and gifts delivery management system
     - Robotized warehouse management
2. Give a high-level overview of what functions and use cases are relevant for the chosen system.
3. Design entities and their attributes, relationships between them. Describe them.
4. Draw an ER diagram depicting the designed entities, attributes (with data types), and relationships.
   Please note that you may refer to the overview of ER diagrams here **https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams**.
5. The task should be submitted as a doc document or a pdf document.

**How to self-evaluate this task:**

Please be aware that we expect the completed task to meet the following criteria:

- A high-level overview of functions and use cases of the chosen system should be provided.
- Entities, their attributes, and relations should be designed and fully described.
- An ER diagram depicting the designed entities, their attributes with data types, and relationships should be drawn.
